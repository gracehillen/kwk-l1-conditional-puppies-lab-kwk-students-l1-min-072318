Fork and clone this lab then write some conditional statements in `puppies.rb` to make the tests pass and help her control these K-9s!

# 1. Write a method called no_puppies that takes in a number of puppies as an argument. If the number of puppies is greater than zero then this method should return "No more puppies!" otherwise it should return "Well done, Rachel!"
